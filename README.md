This is the first coding challenge of John Cricket's coding challenges for junior developers. <br>
I used java to code a toy cat tool. <br>

<br>
To run the program, you can run the command: <br>    < java -classpath target/classes org.example.Main *args* >. <br>
It accepts two flags: *-n* meaning to number all lines and *-b* meaning to number all non-blank lines only. <br>
If a single hyphen '-' is given or there is no file name given, the program will read from standard in. <br>
